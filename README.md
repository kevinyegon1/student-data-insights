# student-data-insights
📌 Project Overview
This project explores the behavioral patterns of students learning Python. By analyzing metrics like debugging frequency, forum participation, and prior experience, I developed a high-accuracy predictive model to determine if a student will pass their final examination.

📊 The Dataset
The data tracks 15 key features including:

Behavioral: hours_spent_learning_per_week, practice_problems_solved, debugging_sessions.

Engagement: uses_kaggle, participates_in_discussion_forums.

Experience: prior_programming_experience.

Target: passed_exam (Binary).

📈 Key Findings (Univariate Analysis)
Through initial data exploration, several clear trends emerged:

Skill Gap: The majority of students are beginners, with a significant drop-off in intermediate and advanced learners.

Low Engagement: Most students do not utilize Kaggle and have completed fewer than 4 projects.

Performance: The modal score range sits between 40-60 marks, leading to a high initial failure rate across the cohort.

Effort Distribution: Most students commit 5-8 hours per week, solving roughly 55-65 problems.
